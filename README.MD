Just messing around with the SFML libraries here. Creating a nice object system which will hopefully expand to a working physics/game engine. An 'Entity' denotes something which has a position on the screen, whereas a 'PhysicalObject' denotes something that has a position as well as a velocity and an acceleration. Basically I wanted to seperate things that can be drawn to the screen and moved around such as a character in a topdown dungeon crawler, versus things that behave like physical objects that can be moved around through the physical laws, like a basketball for instance. To add a force to a PhysicalObject, just use obj.register_force(new Force()) where Force is the pure abstract base class for all forces. So far the only forces are Gravity and a MouseForce, which is just a dumb thing that exerts a force in the direction of the current mouse position.

For the future, I plan to implement Scene Graphs, so that a graph of drawable things can be made, where each node only needs to track it's position and orientation relative to it's parent. Feedback appreciated.
